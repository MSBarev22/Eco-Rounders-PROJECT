      <div class="country-eco-info">China confronts a multifaceted array of environmental challenges as it undergoes rapid industrialization and urbanization. Chief among these is pervasive air pollution, primarily driven by industrial emissions, vehicular exhaust, and coal combustion. This has profound implications for public health and ecosystem well-being. Water pollution is another critical issue, stemming from industrial discharges, untreated sewage, and agricultural runoff, posing risks to both aquatic ecosystems and human populations. The cumulative impact of these factors contributes to soil pollution, further intensifying environmental concerns. Recognizing the interconnected nature of these challenges, China has been working on various initiatives to address environmental degradation, emphasizing sustainable practices, technological innovations, and policy reforms. As the country continues to prioritize economic development, finding a balance that mitigates environmental impact remains a central focus.</div>
