      <div class="country-eco-info">The Czech Republic grapples with a spectrum of environmental challenges, notably air pollution concentrated in urban areas due to industrial emissions and transportation-related pollutants, exacerbated historically by reliance on coal for energy production. This has led to elevated levels of particulate matter, posing risks to public health. Agricultural activities contribute to water pollution in rivers and lakes, with the use of fertilizers and pesticides impacting water quality. Deforestation remains a concern, impacting biodiversity and ecosystem health, although the country has initiated reforestation efforts. Climate change effects, including altered precipitation patterns, pose threats to agriculture and ecosystems. The Czech Republic is actively transitioning to renewable energy sources to mitigate its carbon footprint, reflecting a commitment to sustainability. Striking a balance between economic development and environmental preservation remains a pivotal challenge, necessitating ongoing efforts in sustainable practices, conservation, and the adoption of cleaner technologies to ensure a more ecologically resilient future.</div>
