      <div class="country-eco-info">El Salvador confronts a host of environmental challenges that impact its ecosystems and the well-being of its population. Deforestation, driven by agricultural expansion, logging, and urbanization, poses a significant threat to the country's biodiversity, leading to habitat loss and soil degradation. This, in turn, affects the agricultural sector and exacerbates the risk of landslides and flooding. Water pollution is a critical concern, with contamination from industrial discharges, agricultural runoff, and inadequate sanitation systems affecting rivers and coastal areas. Limited access to clean water and sanitation infrastructure poses health risks for communities. El Salvador is vulnerable to extreme weather events, including hurricanes and tropical storms, which can result in widespread flooding and landslides. Climate change further amplifies these risks, affecting agriculture and exacerbating existing environmental challenges. Additionally, the country faces social and economic issues related to environmental degradation, with marginalized communities often disproportionately affected by these challenges.</div>
