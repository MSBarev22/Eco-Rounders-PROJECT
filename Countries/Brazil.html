      <div class="country-eco-info">Certainly! Brazil faces multifaceted economic challenges that encompass profound income inequality, characterized by a substantial wealth gap between different socioeconomic segments, leading to social disparities and economic imbalances. The country grapples with a notable burden of public debt, impacting government spending and long-term economic stability, thereby restricting resources for vital social and economic programs. Corruption, prevalent within government institutions and businesses, undermines economic development, erodes trust, and diminishes investor confidence, impeding sustainable growth. Inadequate infrastructure across various sectors, including transportation, healthcare, and education, impedes economic advancement and development potential. Additionally, Brazil confronts pressing environmental concerns, notably deforestation in the Amazon rainforest, posing ecological risks and global environmental implications. Addressing these challenges necessitates comprehensive strategies focusing on reducing income inequality, tackling corruption, investing in infrastructure, and implementing sustainable environmental policies to foster inclusive and resilient economic growth in Brazil.</div>
