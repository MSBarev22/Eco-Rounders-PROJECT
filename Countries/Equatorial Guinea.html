      <div class="country-eco-info">Equatorial Guinea contends with a spectrum of environmental challenges that affect its diverse ecosystems and local communities. Deforestation, driven by logging, agriculture, and urban expansion, poses a threat to the country's rich biodiversity and contributes to soil erosion. The oil industry, a major economic driver, raises concerns about environmental degradation, including oil spills and pollution. Water scarcity is a pressing issue, aggravated by population growth, inefficient water management, and climate change impacts. Inadequate sanitation infrastructure and poor waste management contribute to water pollution, affecting both freshwater sources and coastal areas. Mangrove ecosystems, vital for coastal protection, are vulnerable to degradation from human activities. The country is susceptible to extreme weather events, including tropical storms, which can lead to flooding and landslides. The challenges of environmental sustainability are intertwined with social and economic factors, requiring comprehensive strategies to balance economic development with conservation efforts and address the needs of local communities.</div>
