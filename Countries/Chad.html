      <div class="country-eco-info">Chad is a country located in central Africa, and is bordered by Libya, Niger, Nigeria and Cameroon, the Central African Republic, and Sudan. The Sahara, the Sahel, and the Savanna surround Chad and since itâ€™s mostly forest and desert, the climate is hot and tropical. The north is the driest region and has little rain all year, unlike the southern and central regions that do have rainy seasons. For the most part, Chad holds its dry season and is often windy. Chad is one of the world's poorest countries, and in 2003 over 54% of the population were living below the poverty line. Poverty plays a key role in the country because it contributes to the severe environmental issues in Chad. Also, a largely rural population relies heavily upon the natural resources. The three chief damaging environmental issues in Chad is desertification, the lack of fresh water, and the locust swarms. The effects of these issues have shown as the northern half of Chad has become a desert, Lake Chad has decreased in size and amount of fresh water to supply, and the highly relied agriculture is in jeopardy. Information technology plays a role in Chad to manage groundwater, in food security, and in communications.</div>
