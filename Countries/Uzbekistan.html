<div class="country-eco-info">Uzbekistan faces ecological challenges, including water scarcity, soil degradation, and threats to biodiversity. Addressing these issues involves implementing sustainable land and water management practices, efficient agricultural practices, and biodiversity conservation efforts. Investments in renewable energy sources, such as solar power, contribute to environmental sustainability. Strengthening waste management systems, promoting sustainable agriculture, and engaging communities in environmental stewardship are vital for balanced development. Public awareness campaigns and educational initiatives play a key role in promoting eco-friendly practices. Protecting natural habitats and combating desertification are crucial for biodiversity preservation. Collaboration with international organizations and neighboring countries is essential for Uzbekistan to navigate its ecological challenges, ensuring the preservation of its diverse landscapes and building a more sustainable future.</div>

Uzbekistan's cities, including Bukhara and Khiva, showcase Islamic architecture and intricate tilework. The country is bordered by the Kyzylkum Desert and Tian Shan Mountains.
