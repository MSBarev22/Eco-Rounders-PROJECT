      <div class="country-eco-info">Burundi grapples with various economic challenges that impede its growth and development. The country's heavy reliance on agriculture, which forms the backbone of its economy, renders it vulnerable to weather fluctuations, impacting food security and income stability for a vast segment of the population. Persistent high levels of poverty and food insecurity continue to affect a significant portion of Burundi's inhabitants, exacerbating socio-economic disparities. Moreover, periodic political unrest and conflicts have disrupted economic activities, hampering foreign investments essential for sustainable development. Inadequate infrastructure across transportation, energy, and healthcare sectors poses significant hurdles, limiting access to vital services and hindering economic progress. The challenges in healthcare and education systems further impede human capital development, stifling the potential growth of a skilled workforce. Addressing these multifaceted challenges requires comprehensive strategies focusing on agricultural diversification, political stability, infrastructure development, and robust investments in healthcare and education to foster sustainable economic growth and improve living standards in Burundi.</div>
