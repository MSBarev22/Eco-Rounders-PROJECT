<div class="country-eco-info">Yemen faces severe ecological challenges, exacerbated by conflict, including deforestation, water scarcity, and soil degradation. Addressing these issues involves implementing sustainable land and water management practices, efficient agricultural techniques, and efforts to combat desertification. Humanitarian and environmental aid are crucial for immediate relief and long-term sustainability. Strengthening waste management, promoting renewable energy sources, and engaging communities in environmental stewardship are vital for balanced development. Public awareness campaigns and educational initiatives play a key role in promoting eco-friendly practices. International collaboration and support are essential for Yemen to navigate its ecological challenges, ensuring the preservation of its landscapes and building a more sustainable future once the conflict is resolved.</div>
